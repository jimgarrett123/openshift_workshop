Using SSL in your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic
with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We
will be using the *binarydeploy-UserName* that you created in the previous
labs. Make sure you are switched to that project by using the *oc
project* command. *Remember* to substitute UserName.

....
$ oc project binarydeploy-UserName
....


*Step 2: View the routing config*

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route`
command

....
$ oc get route/myapp -o yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2018-04-09T15:40:04Z
  labels:
    app: myapp
  name: myapp
  namespace: jimgarrett
  resourceVersion: "127925718"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/jimgarrett/routes/myapp
  uid: 45bc5aec-3c0c-11e8-888a-02722ccca8d2
spec:
  host: myapp-jimgarrett.apps.rhpds.openshift.opentlc.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: myapp
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2018-04-09T15:40:04Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: myapp-jimgarrett.apps.rhpds.openshift.opentlc.com
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is
running on.

Currently the routing component of OpenShift 3 supports ports `80` and
`443`. When you first create your route, the mapping of `80` to your pod
is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in
order to get the `443` mapping to work.

*Step 3: TLS Edge Termination*

OpenShift has a _wildcard_ SSL certificate that it can use for any
application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our
application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is
sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

....
oc edit route/myapp
....

You are going to add `tls: termination: edge` right below the `host:`
section. It should look something like this.

....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2018-04-09T15:40:04Z
  labels:
    app: myapp
  name: myapp
  namespace: jimgarrett
  resourceVersion: "127925718"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/jimgarrett/routes/myapp
  uid: 45bc5aec-3c0c-11e8-888a-02722ccca8d2
spec:
  host: myapp-jimgarrett.apps.rhpds.openshift.opentlc.com
  tls:
    termination: edge
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: myapp
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2018-04-09T15:40:04Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: myapp-jimgarrett.apps.rhpds.openshift.opentlc.com
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

*Step 4: Verify*

The Route for the application should now reflect the SSL connection (i.e. https verses http in the link).

Please click on the new Route and verify the new Route works as expected.

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL
from your application

Let's clean up the project.

....
oc delete project binarydeploy-UserName
