Using Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab exercise we will learn how to use OpenShift Web Console to
spin up a mariadb database using templates. We will then add a frontend
PHP application that accesses this database using the service exposed by
the database. We will provide a route (a URL) to access the frontend
application from a browser.

*Step 1: Create a Project*

Based on the experience gained from the previous exercise, log into the
OpenShift Web Console. Click on the  *Home* tab and select the *Projects* subtab.  You will see the list of Projects.

Using the *Create Project* button, create a new project. We will call it
*consoleproject-UserName*. Replace by your username to make this project
unique. Type in a *Display Name* and *Description* of your choice.

Press the *Create* button to complete the project creation from the Web
Console. This will accomplish the same job as `oc new-project` from CLI.

Next click on the *Administrator* menu and select the *Developer* option.

*Step 2: Create a MariaDB database using the template*

Click on *Topology -> From Catolog* button

In the "*Filter by keyword*" field type '*mariadb*'

Find *MariaDB (Ephemeral)* template from the list and click *Select*.

Click the *Instantiate Template* button

Edit the values to use the following values:

....
Database Service Name:     mariadb
MariaDB Connection Username: pricelist
MariaDB Connection Password: pricelist
MariaDB root user Password:  pricelist
MariaDB Database Name:       pricelist
....

Click the "*Create*" button

Naviagete back to the *Toplogy* page and soon you will see
an image of a running pod.

*Step 3: Add data to MaraiaDB database*

Let us see how we can enter the pod and access the database.

From the command line, change the project to the
`<your_project>` using the following command:

----
$ oc project <your_project>
----

Based on what you learned previously get the list of running pods by running:

----
$ oc get pods
----

You will find one pod for mariadb running. Take a note of it's name.

Enter the pod by running the following command. Substitute the pod name
with your mariadb pod name.

----
$ oc rsh mariadb-1-x8hpk

bash-4.2$
----

You will be taken to a bash prompt inside the running pod.

[source,sh]
----
mariadb -h127.0.0.1 -P3306 -upricelist -p
----

You will be taken to the `MariaDB` prompt. See the list of databases. You
will notice that the sample database that you requested is added and
available.

[source,sh]
----
mariadb> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| pricelist          |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
----

Change over to use the `pricelist` database.

[source,sh]
----
mariadb> use pricelist;
Database changed
----

Let's us create two tables and add some records using the commands shown below.

Create the table:

[source,sql]
----
create table products (
id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
name varchar(32) NOT NULL,
description text NOT NULL,
price int(11) NOT NULL,
category_id int(11) NOT NULL,
created datetime NOT NULL,
modified timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
PRIMARY KEY  (id)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=14 ;

create table categories (
id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
name varchar(256) NOT NULL,
created datetime NOT NULL,
modified timestamp NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
PRIMARY KEY  (id)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=4 ;

----

Now we add some data:

[source,sql]
----
insert into categories VALUES(1, 'Fashion', '2014-06-01 00:35:07', '2014-05-31 09:34:33');
insert into categories VALUES(2, 'Electronics', '2014-06-01 00:35:07', '2014-05-31 09:34:33');
insert into categories VALUES(3, 'Motors', '2014-06-01 00:35:07', '2014-05-31 09:34:54');
insert into categories VALUES(4, 'Miscellaneous', '2014-06-01 00:35:07', '2014-05-31 09:34:54');
----

Verify that the records you added are there:

[source,sql]
----
select * from categories;
----

Now `exit` mariadb client and `exit` out of the pod.

*Step 4: Add a PHP frontend to talk to this database*

In this step we will add a PHP frontend application that talks to
recently created database. The code is available on github at
https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/php-pricelist

Browse through the code in this repository. If you take a look at the
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/php-pricelist/master/config/database.php[database configuration] file (`config/database.php`) you will see that it reads the values from environment varables.

To add a new application click on *+Add* in the upper left corner of the console window.

Next click on the "From Catalog" button.

In the *Filter by keyword* field type *PHP*, then select the one titled *PHP*

image:images/php.png[image]

Enter the following values for each parameters:

....
* Name: pricelist
* Git Repository URL: https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/php-pricelist
....

At the bottom of the page, in the *Advanced Options* section, click on *Build Configuration*.

On the Build Configuration page add the following *Environment Variables* to the application:

Add the following Environment variables to the application:

....
MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST : mariadb
MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT : 3306
MYSQL_DATABASE     : pricelist
MYSQL_USER         : pricelist
MYSQL_PASSWORD     : pricelist
....


Click *Create* to add this application.

Navigate back to the *Topology* page and you will
see the new service is now available and exposed as a route.

You will also notice that a build starts running very soon. Once the
build completes, the application image created from the source code will
be uploaded to the docker repository.

You can check the build logs using the following command:

....
$ oc logs build/pricelist-1
Cloning "https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/php-pricelist" ...

....

Once the build completes, OpenShift initiates a deploy process. Once the
deployment is complete, the frontend pod starts running.

When complete click on the *Route* for the application.

The application should display in the Browser.  Click the *+Create Record* button and create a new Record.

Then click on the *Read Records* button to return to the main page, you should see your new record.
