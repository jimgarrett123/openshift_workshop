~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab exercise, we will review the OpenShift Web Console.

Type in the master public URL provided by your instructor in a browser.
Use `<master public URL>:<port>`. You will be directed to an OpenShift
login page.

*Note*: Your browser may complain about the serverâ€™s security
certificates not trusted by your computer. You can agree to proceed to
the master URL.

When you select the *time* pod it will display a panel to the right that
contains the *Overview* and *Resources* panels.

In the *Resource* panel you can see that a single pod is
running and is front ended by a service. Note the route that you
configured for this service is also shown.

Select *Builds* under *Builds* tab, you will see all the build
configurations. Select the *time* Build Config, we will be able to view all the build details.
