[red]#OVERVIEW#

Containers have revolutionized the DevOps process, transforming how organizations build, ship, and run applications on any infrastructure.

OpenShift Container Platform is an enterprise container application platform based on industry standards, Docker, and Kubernetes. OpenShift can help organizations accelerate moving existing applications to the cloud, speed the time-to-market of new products, and deliver more innovation to customers.

In this workshop, we will discuss how containers solve many of the challenges for development and operations. We will show you how to start taking advantage of the cloud, without rewriting all of your existing applications. We will demonstrate how OpenShift can improve speed, scalability, security, innovation and cost to your IT organization.
